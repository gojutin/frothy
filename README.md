## About

Frothy is a highly customizable, drop-in authentication form component built with [React](https://reactjs.org/), the [Firebase SDK](https://firebase.google.com/docs/database/web/start) and [Styled-Components](https://www.styled-components.com/). The library is approximately 104 KB minified and 25 KB gzipped.

##### Frothy supports the following Firebase authentication features:

* Login with Email/Password
* Sign Up with Email/Password
* Google Login
* Facebook Login
* Twitter Login
* GitHub Login
* Login with Phone Number (with Recaptcha)
* Anonymous Login
* Send Password Reset Link

##### Here are just some of the features that Frothy provides:

* Control over which Firebase authentication methods are included
* Display as an inline form or a modal with a single prop setting
* Plenty of styling configuration options
* Recaptcha configuration options
* Custom password rules
* Smooth animations
* No CSS imports required
* WAI-ARIA compliant

> Please Read: This is a new project and has not been thoroughly tested. At the moment, it is not recommended to use this library in production apps. If you'd like to help get it there, your contributions would be greatly appreciated! Currently, this library is not compatible with React Native due to DOM dependencies. This may change in the future.

<a name="getting-started"/>

## Getting Started

In order to use this component, it must be installed with npm along with the `firebase` and `styled-components` npm packages.

`npm i frothy firebase styled-components` or `yarn add frothy firebase styled-components`

Firebase must also be configured for your React project. This process is simple (and free). Here is a rough overview of the process:

In Firebase:

* Create a (free) Firebase project at [https://firebase.google.com/](https://firebase.google.com/).

- In the Firebase console, go to `Authentication > SIGN-IN METHOD` and enable all of the sign-in providers that you are interested in supporting. Firebase will walk you through the necessary steps for each one.

In your React project:

Add your Firebase config to your main `index.js` file. You can find your config in the Firebase console at `Authentication > WEB SETUP`

```
import firebase from 'firebase';

const prodConfig = {
  // apiKey: YOUR_API_KEY,
  // authDomain: YOUR_AUTH_DOMAIN,
  // databaseURL: YOUR_DATABASE_URL,
  // projectId: YOUR_PROJECT_ID,
  // storageBucket: '',
  // messagingSenderId: YOUR_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID,
};

firebase.initializeApp(config);
```

Once Firebase is wired up, just import Frothy component and drop it into your app.

```js
// import it
import Frothy from 'frothy';

// use it
<Frothy />;
```

Prefer a modal?

```js
<Frothy modal />
```

By default, Frothy takes care of grabbing the `firebase.auth` method and passing it to the components as long as you have the `firebase` npm package installed.

However, it is possible to manually pass in the Firebase auth method, which allows you to use a production build of the Firebase SDK.

```js
import 'firebase' from 'firebase/app';
import 'firebase/auth';

<Frothy auth={firebase.auth} />
```

<a name="props"/>

## Props

Out of the box, a Frothy instance includes all of the supported Firebase features outlined above. However, a Frothy instance can be customized to include only the features that you want to support via props. The component will automatically reconfigure it's layout based on the features that you have chosen to implement. Several styling props and other custom configuration options are also exposed and documented below.

Here is a list of all of the props that Frothy exposes:

### auth

`PropTypes.func`

Default Value: Firebase Development SDK

Description: Optionally pass in the firebase.auth method. By default, this library uses the development build of the Firebase SDK, which is not recommended for production.

### modal

`PropTypes.bool`

  recaptchaBadge="inline"
  anonymous={true}
  google={true}
  facebook={true}
  twitter={true}
  github={true}
/>;
```

<a name="access-user"/>

## Accessing User and Authentication State

Firebase offers a couple convenient methods to access the user and authentication state:

Authentication State Observer (recommended)

```js
import firebase from 'firebase';

firebase.auth().onAuthStateChanged(function(user) {
  if (user) {
    // User is signed in.
  } else {
    // No user is signed in.
  }
});
```

`currentUser` property

```js
import firebase from 'firebase';

const user = firebase.auth().currentUser;

if (user) {
  // User is signed in.
} else {
  // No user is signed in.
}
```

The Frothy [demo](https://frothy-123.firebaseapp.com/) utilizes the Authentication State Observer to control access to routes based on authentication status. Feel free to dig into the demo's source code to see how this works.

## Design Decisions

This library aims to strike a nice balance between plenty of configuration options and simplicity in getting started.

After initially writing all of the styles with inline JavaScript, it was decided to refactor the project to use `styled-components`. The `styled-components` library is not included as a dependency due to the conflicts associated with having two installations in the same project. Instead, it is a required peer dependency that will need to be imported along with `firebase`. `styled-components` includes vendor prefixing, which allows this package to be supported by more browsers. It also injects the styles directly into the document, which means that you do not need to require any additional CSS files.
